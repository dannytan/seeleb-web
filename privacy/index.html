<strong>Privacy Policy</strong> <p>
	Daniel Tan built the Seeleb app as
	a Free app. This SERVICE is provided by
	Daniel Tan at no cost and is intended for use as
	is.
</p> <p>
	This page is used to inform visitors regarding my
	policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal
	Information if anyone decided to use my Service.
</p> <p>
	If you choose to use my Service, then you agree to
	the use of information in relation to this
	policy. The Personal Information that I collect is
	used for providing and improving the Service. I will not use or share your information with
	anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.
</p> <p>
	The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings
	as in our Terms and Conditions, which is accessible at
	Seeleb unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy.
</p> <p><strong>Information We Use But Do Not Collect</strong></p> <p>
	For use of Seeleb you may upload face images to Seeleb. In
	order to make possible for you to use certain functions of Seeleb, we will process (provided by you)
	human face images through Amazon Web Services Rekognition API technologies that will provide us
	information about such human faces’ position, orientation, and identity. For more information about AWS Rekognition API technology I use, you may visit:
	https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rekognition/latest/dg/celebrities.html.
	Images that you provide us in or through Seeleb, and/or other information related
	to human faces obtained from your images and/or through the use of AWS Rekognition
	API technologies, are the “Image Data”. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in other Sections of this Privacy Policy in relation to the
	Personal Data, we do not:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>collect, store, share or transfer the Image Data uploaded though the application in any way;</li>
	<li>collect, store, share or transfer the Image Data off the User devices;</li>
	<li>use the Image Data for authentication, advertising, or marketing purposes, or to otherwise target
		a User in a similar manner;</li>
	<li>transfer, share, sell, or otherwise provide the Image Data to advertising platforms, analytics
		providers, data brokers, information resellers or other such parties.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Links to Other Sites</strong></p> <p>
	This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on
	a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note
	that these external sites are not operated by me.
	Therefore, I strongly advise you to review the
	Privacy Policy of these websites. I have
	no control over and assume no responsibility for the content,
	privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or
	services.
</p> <p><strong>Children’s Privacy</strong></p> <p>
	These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13.
	I do not knowingly collect personally
	identifiable information from children under 13. In the case
	I discover that a child under 13 has provided
	me with personal information, I immediately
	delete this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian
	and you are aware that your child has provided us with
	personal information, please contact me so that
	I will be able to do necessary actions.
</p> <p><strong>Changes to This Privacy Policy</strong></p> <p>
	I may modify or update this Privacy Policy from time to time, so please review
	it periodically. I may provide you additional forms of notice of modifications or updates as appropriate under the circumstances. Your continued use of Seeleb after any modification to this
	Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such modification. In some cases, I may require
	you to expressly accept new privacy policy in order to continue using Seeleb (for example if I
	expand types of Collected Information or introduce new purposes of collection and processing).
</p> <p>This policy is effective as of 2020-05-26</p> <p><strong>Contact Me</strong></p> <p>
	If you have any questions or suggestions about my
	Privacy Policy, do not hesitate to contact me at seeleb.app@gmail.com.
